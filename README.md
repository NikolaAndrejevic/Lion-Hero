Game created by Nikola Andrejevic and Ilya Matveyev

An arcade game for the PC where the player must use the arrow keys or "AWDS" to move the character around the screen to 
avoid the line obstacles and collect power-ups to survive as long as possible. Score is based mostly on how long the 
player survives. The game also contains music and full visual and sounds effects.

Notes:
- The online highscore list is no longer functional because the online database was suspended due to inactivity.
- The desktop launcher may no longer function due to changes in the library and minor tweaks in game code. To see
the game in action, simply run the .jar file
- Java source files can be found in /core/src/com/mygdx/game/  The rest of the files are part of LibGDX library which are created when creating a libGDX project
